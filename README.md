# Side_Bar
Sidebars have played an essential role in web design. They are undoubtedly convenient for information. Up until the last few years, the sidebar has proven to be a great tool in web design, allowing us to:

<ul>
  <li>Include information that might not otherwise fit on a page.</li>
  <li>Give visitors value-added material.</li>
  <li>Focus on content that might get lost in the blog heap but deserves a prominent spot.</li>
  <li>Run ads, whether they were your own or from affiliates.</li>
  <li>Share live feeds from social media.</li>
  <li>Include recent post links, categories, tags, RSS subscription forms, search boxes, and more to improve the blog's navigation.</li>
</ul>

If a sidebar enables visitors to navigate the site easily, and if you have other creative ways to deal with navigation seamlessly, ditch the sidebar. The most common solution is to have a main page or landing page without a sidebar and then a sidebar in the blog section.
